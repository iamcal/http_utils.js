http_utils.js - An HTTP utility library for node.js
===================================================

If you're using HTTPServer in node.js, this library allows you to skip the tedious
argument parsing for GET, POST and multipart POST params, instead delivering them
ready-parsed into req.get and req.post objects.

Simple usage example:

    http_utils.createSimpleServer(function (req, res){

        console.log("GET params: "+sys.inspect(req.get));
        console.log("POST params: "+sys.inspect(req.post));

    }).listen(1234);

Internally the library implements sub-header parsing and multipart decoding. You 
probably don't need to call any of that directly.
